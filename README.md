# ImageDataAugmentation-and-Classification
Increased dataset size &amp; ML model to classify Images.
Creating and expanding the size of your image dataset using image data augmentation. If you are low on your dataset, data augmentation creates variations and modification in an image to increase your training dataset that in turn improve your model performance. Data augmentation performs transformations on an image and each transformed version of the image contributes to the dataset. Transforms include image rotation, zooming, shifts, flips and brightness adjustment. I'm using the Keras deep learning library that provides us with the ImageDataGenerator class to automatically generate augmented images for our training dataset.
Initially I took a bird image from the google images and with that ONE image in hand, I try and increase my dataset count using image data augmentation technique and further classify them into 2 class using machine learning models.
